# 2021_group20_final_project
Final project for the course "22100 - R for Bio Data Science". The contributors to the project are Mikkel Spallou Eriksen, Rut Mas de Les Valls, Anna Oliver Almirall, Paul Jeremy Simon and Elisa Catafal Tardos.

# Dataset
Original paper : Yeoh EJ, Ross ME, Shurtleff SA, et al. Classification, subtype discovery, and prediction of outcome in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia by gene expression profiling. Cancer Cell. 2002;1(2):133-143. doi:10.1016/s1535-6108(02)00032-6

The dataset has been downloaded from
```r
library(stjudem)
```
It has been tidied to reach a clean dataset similar to the one given [here](https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray/wiki/Yeoh-%282002%29).

# Outline
All R scripts are available in the folder R/  
1. 01_load loads the dataset and writes it into tsv.gz files  
2. 02_clean filters cancer types and convert probe names into gene names  
3. 03_pre_analysis selects the top40 differetially expressed gene for each cancer subtype  
4. 04_plot performs several kind of statistical descriptive plots  
5. 05_plots_heatmap aims at reproducing heatmaps from the paper  
6. 06_kmeans performs a k means clustering on raw dataset and top40 genes dataset  
7. 07_pca performs a PCA on raw dataset and top40 genes dataset  

A shiny app with plots has been created and is available [here](https://paul-simon.shinyapps.io/yeoh_plots/)
